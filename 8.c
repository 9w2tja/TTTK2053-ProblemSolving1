/* Write a program to process weekly employee time cards for all employees of
an organization. Each employee will have three data items: an identification
number, the hourly wage rate, and the number of hours worked during a given
week.

Each employee is to be paid time and a half for all hours worked over
40. A tax amount of 3.625% of gross salary will be deducted.

The program output
should show the employeeâ€™s number and net pay. Display the total payroll
and the average amount paid at the end of the run.

Input
ID, Hour Wage & Hour Work

Algorithm

Output
ID, Net Pay. total payroll & average
